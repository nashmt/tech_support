# MVC pattern
# Status: accepted
# Context:
When designing a web application, it is important to think about the layout of your files.

# Decision:
I have decided to use the Model-View-Controller pattern because it is simple and I am familiar with it. All of the files in my application are already implemented this way.

# Consequences:
The MVC pattern is a simple and clean method for organizing files. It allows for separation of concerns, particularly between front-end and back-end development.
