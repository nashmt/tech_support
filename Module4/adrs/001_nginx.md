# Choice of Web Server
# Status: accepted
# Context:
In need of a simple and lightweight web server for developing class projects.

# Decision:

I chose to use Nginx because of its high concurrency, high performance and low memory usage. It is popular with many developers and I felt that it would be useful to become familiar with.

# Consequences:

What will be difficult is learning how to configure an unfamiliar webserver to suit my project needs.
