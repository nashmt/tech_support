# Operational data
# Status: accepted
# Context:
For Module 4, I am required to provide operational data. Operational data has to do with information that is necessary for business procedures and processes.
# Decision:
I have included the operational data for my sample application within a SQL file that loads into the database.
# Consequences:
All necessary data for the application to run is installed and ready to go.
