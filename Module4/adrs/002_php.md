# Choice of server-side language
# Status: accepted
# Context:
For my web-application to run, I need to choose a scripting language for the server-side.

# Decision:
I have chosen PHP because I am familiar with it from my server-side programming classes.

# Consequences:
By choosing PHP, I hope to have an easier time making any necessary coding changes in the future.
