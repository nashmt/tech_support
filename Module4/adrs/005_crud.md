# CRUD
# Status: accepted
# Context:
CRUD stands for create, read, update, and delete. Together, they form the four basic functions of persistent storage in a database. For my web application, it is important to incorporate these capabilities so that managers can perform the basic operations of running a business.
# Decision:
I have decided to integrate PHP and SQL statements so that the application can manipulate the database as necessary.
# Consequences:
I may have difficulty learning how to integrate these statements (knowing which extensions to install) in a new and unfamiliar Docker environment.
