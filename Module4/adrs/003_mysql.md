# Choice of Database
# Status: accepted
# Context:
For this class assignment, I am required to choose a database to extract data from.

# Decision:
I have chosen MySQL because I am familiar with SQL from previous database classes.

# Consequences:
I hope to have an easier time working with a database that I am strongly familiar with.
